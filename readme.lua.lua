If anyone does use this script i appreciate it!

Anyways let me talk you through it, so you will install this into your resources folder and you will then start it in 
your server CFG, you will then go into the help-c.lua and you will change the example to your discord and website link
if you have one.

If you have any trouble please join my new CodingClub discord: https://discord.gg/AFjfCcP6gj
If you are interested in my server you can join it here: https://discord.gg/bHuuQvq2c9

If you have any questions feel free to open a ticket on the CodingClub discord!

Thank you again if you use this script!
